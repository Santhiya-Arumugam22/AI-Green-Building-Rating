#  AI-Based Green Building Rating System

##  Overview
Buildings consume nearly 40% of global energy.
This project predicts a building's sustainability rating
before construction using Machine Learning.

##  Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Energy Efficiency of Buildings
- Records: 768 buildings
- Features:
  - Relative Compactness
  - Surface Area
  - Wall Area
  - Roof Area
  - Overall Height
  - Orientation
  - Glazing Area
  - Glazing Area Distribution

##  Methodology
1. Data preprocessing
2. Green Score creation
3. Regression (score prediction)
4. Classification (green rating)
5. Feature importance analysis

##  Green Rating Levels
| Score | Rating |
|------|--------|
| 80–100 | Platinum |
| 60–79 | Gold |
| 40–59 | Silver |
| < 40 | Non-Green |

##  Models Used
- Random Forest Regressor
- Random Forest Classifier

##  Outcome
Predicts sustainable building design decisions before construction.
